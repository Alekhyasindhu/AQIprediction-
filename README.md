This project implements an AI-based air quality monitoring and forecasting system using LSTM networks. It integrates IoT sensor data and OpenWeatherMap API data to predict pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO, and CO. The system enables real-time monitoring and early warnings for healthier campus environments
